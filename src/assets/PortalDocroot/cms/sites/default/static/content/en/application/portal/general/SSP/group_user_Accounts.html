<p>If you are&nbsp;accessing myIATA using multiple accounts, it can be easier for you if you group
them together and access all of them by logging in using any of the grouped account logins. Provide
the login details below for the accounts that you want to add to the group and then repeat this
procedure until you have all the accounts that you want to have in the group. Next time when you
log in with any of the passwords for your account, you can access all account with that login by
simply clicking 'Change Account' in the left menu. Please note that your password will not be saved
by the system.</p>
<p>Note that you can always remove an account from the group by clicking the checkbox of the
account and then 'Remove from group'.</p>
