<h1>About Reverse Charges</h1>
<h4>What are reverse charges?</h4>
<p>IATA has implemented its centralized structure whereby the local office of IATA no longer issues
invoices. The invoices you receive will be issued from Montreal, Canada and will not include VAT.
The invoices will include a comment on them similar to: No VAT is included on this invoice on the
basis that Article 21(b) of the Sixth VAT Directive applies to the invoiced amounts.</p>
<p>
<u>This does not mean that VAT no longer applies to the services invoiced to you by IATA</u>. Since
the invoice is rendered to you from outside your country, you must self-assess the VAT on the
purchase using the so-called reverse charge mechanism. Of course, you are entitled to claim the
input VAT amount on the same return.</p>
