<h1>About Electronic Signature</h1>
<h4>What is electronic signature and why is it required?</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The electronic signature provides a guarantee of
integrity of origin and content.&nbsp; It is currently only required by law for electronically
transmitted documents that are intended to function as invoices, or as supporting documentation for
invoices for VAT purposes.
<br />The electronic signature provides audit evidence for local tax authorities to verify VAT
paid. Documents that do not serve this function therefore do not legally require an electronic
signature.</p>
<h4 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">What will I still receive paper copies of some
invoices?</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText3">Currently, all IATA invoices are electronically signed and are posted
myIATA. Paper copies will not be automatically provided. The customer has the option to request a
paper invoice. You will continue to receive paper invoices if electronic signatures are not yet
available in your market.&nbsp; Electronic invoices without an electronic signature are not valid
invoices for VAT purposes.</p>
<h4 class="MsoBodyText3">Do I have to keep a paper copy of my electronic invoices?</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">When legally adopted in your country, it is not
necessary to retain an additional paper copy of electronically signed invoice.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must
save the electronic version for future tax inspections.
