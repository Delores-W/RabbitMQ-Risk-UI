<h1>BSPlink</h1>
<p> BSPlink is the global interface for travel agents and airlines to access the IATA Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP). </p>
<p>IATA provides services for the settlement of financial transactions between travel agents and the airlines. This service consolidates the amounts owed by each agent and the amounts due to each airline and enables the settlement to be made through a single financial transfer for each participant.</p>
