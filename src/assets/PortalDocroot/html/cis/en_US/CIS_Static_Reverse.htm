<h1>About Reverse Charges</h1>
	
		<h3>What are reverse charges?</h3>
		<p>IATA has implemented its centralized structure whereby the local 
		office of IATA no longer issues invoices. The invoices you receive will 
		be issued from Montreal, Canada and will not include VAT. The invoices 
		will include a comment on them similar to: No VAT is included on this 
		invoice on the basis that Article 21(b) of the Sixth VAT Directive 
		applies to the invoiced amounts. </p>
		<p><u>This does not mean that VAT no longer applies to the services 
		invoiced to you by IATA</u>. Since the invoice is rendered to you from 
		outside your country, you must self-assess the VAT on the purchase using 
		the so-called “reverse charge mechanism”. Of course, you are entitled to 
		claim the input VAT amount on the same return. </p>
