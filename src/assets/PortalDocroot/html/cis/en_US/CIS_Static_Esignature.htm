<h1>About Electronic Signature</h1>
	
		<h3>What is electronic signature and why is it required? </h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A guarantee of integrity 
		of origin and content is currently only required by law in respect of 
		electronically-transmitted documents that are intended to function as 
		VAT invoices, or as supporting documentation for invoices.&nbsp; The reason 
		for this is that such documents may require inspection by local tax 
		authorities some time in the future and the tax authorities must be sure 
		that no changes have been made to the invoices that would affect VAT 
		liability.&nbsp; Documents that do not serve this function therefore do not
		<i>legally</i> require signature, though e-signature may be used more 
		widely in the future in respect of many types of documents.</p>
	
		<h3>What will I still receive paper copies of some invoices?</h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText3">Currently, only invoices generated by our DPC 
		supplier for distribution through BSPLink can be electronically signed.&nbsp; 
		You will therefore receive paper copies of the remaining, BSP-generated, 
		invoices.&nbsp; Although advance copies of the invoice may be made available 
		electronically, only the paper copies function as acceptable VAT 
		invoices and therefore must be retained.&nbsp; In the future, it is intended 
		that all IATA invoices will be electronically signed, at which point 
		paper copies will no longer be necessary.</p>
	
		<h3>Do I have to keep a paper copy of my electronic invoices?</h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;No, it is not necessary 
		to retain a paper copy of electronically signed invoices but you must 
		save the electronic version.&nbsp; If you are subject to a tax inspection at 
		a later date the tax authorities would only want to see the 
		electronically signed document.</p>
